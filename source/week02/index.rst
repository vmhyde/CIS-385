Weekly Summary
--------------

This week covered embracing your data analyst skills, thinking analytically about analytical thinking, and thinking about outcomes.
In embracing data analyst skills, the instructor pointed out how many of these skills most people already have. From deciding on how to
organize your contacts in your phone, making a coffee selection or planning out the day, data analytics is a large part of our day.

Analytical thinking involves looking at the bigger picture and using a technical mindset to make decisions. To do this, it's vital to
look at all of the data as a whole, then break that data down into smaller pieces to consider the outcome. Considering and being open to
different outcomes is important in order to avoid making biased decisions.
