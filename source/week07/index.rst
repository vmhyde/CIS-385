This week covered Software and Agile Processes and Practices. Lesson 1 & 2 in Module 1 covered Processes
and Practices and Software Engineering Activities. Differentiating Phases, Activities and Tasks was covered in detail,
along with the importance of understanding when to use them. Lesson 2 covered Software Engineering Activities
which included differentiating roles and work products along with risk management and estimations. While a lot of the

with a team. These practices and processes are put into place to create a consistent and well executed plan and product release.
