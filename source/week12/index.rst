Week 12 Report
==============

Release Plan, Iteration Plan and Product Wireframe (3 hours)
-----------------------------------------------------------
Three interactive assignments were complete for this week including a Release Plan, Iteration Plan and a Product Wireframe
document. Using 3 20 point sprints, user story were organized from the backlog according to priority and risk. Following the release plan,
an iteration plan was organized to evenly distribute number of hours for each developer for the first 3 sprints. The Product Wireframe was
completed to show a rough idea of what the product and it's features will look like.

Creating these documents took extra time re-watching videos, asking the "client" additional questions,
and doing research on best practices.
