Week 13 Report
==============

Sprints, Acceptance Tests & Criteria, Sprint Retrospect, & Iteration Burn Down (4 hours)
-----------------------------------------------------------
Four interactive assignments were complete for this week including a review of all 3 Sprints, Sprint Retrospect, Acceptance Tests and an Iteration Burn Down.
Using the sprint planning assignments after peer review, the documents were reviewed and the corrections and suggested plans were discussed.
The iteration burn down was done by utilizing a spreadsheet and reviewed in detail during the stand up meetings with the team. A developer sent over
a list of acceptance tests and a document was also submitted by the team (me), covering additional criteria.
